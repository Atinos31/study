> Browsers don't allow access to your computer's file system because otherwise malicious websites could delete your files, steal information or perform other malicious actions. It is possible to download or upload files via your browser but only through a secure interface where a user, not a script, decides to download or upload a file. JavaScript code in your browser has no access to files on your computer: it runs in a closed environment also known as a sandbox.
